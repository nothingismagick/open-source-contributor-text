# Tutorial Contents
> This tutorial is a primer for those who are interested in contributing to open-source projects. It may also be useful for active contributors who were always curious about semi-advanced topics. And finally, because licensing can be very contentious, this is also a text for those who want to engage in a discussion about open-source. Although we are using specific examples from the "Quasar Framework", the issues herein are relevant across the spectrum of open-source software development.
> 
> Our hope is that you will gain deeper insight into all of the great things (and potential pitfalls) surrounding licenses in the world of open-source software. The Introduction is a great place to start, as it defines some of the terms this tutorial will constantly return to. It will also teach you about some simple methods for making sure that your contributions are compliant with the licensing scheme taken by the project you are working with. Then it will go into depth about various domains of licensing, including code, copy, design and fonts. Finally, it wraps up with a discussion about your identity and your rights.

### Considerations about your place of residence
### Consideration of the contents of your work
## Font licenses
Of the hundreds of fonts listed at [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/attribution), there are exactly two different licenses used: Either the Apache License v2, or the SIL Open Font License v1.1. The vast majority are OFL
#### SIL Open Font License (OFL)
